# Clone-of-Git-Hub

## Description

This is my recreation of GitHub. Right now it is funcitoning, but in future renditions, I would want to seperate out the UI and the data.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After this project I learned
* how to make Ajax calls and store that data locally
* use nav routing so it is a single page application
* how to use an API and the documentation that goes with it

### Performance Objectives

This project taught me how to 
* pace myself and get a big project done over time
* concepts in SPA and effective ways to use it
* use a REST API with proper authentication
* test JavaScript code that I wrote myself
